# opengl-game-engine
Game engine written with C++ and OpenGL. Currently supports 2D &amp; simple 3D graphics, custom shaders, input, &amp; simple physics.
I wrote most of this during a 6 week period in the summer of 2022, during which I went from reading OpenGL window tutorials to having a functioning interactive environment with a player character, simple collisions, textures and controls. That said, it needs a lot more, and a lot of it is unkempt and due for rewrites. I learned so much writing this software that often by the time I'd finish adding a functionality or section, I would have learned enough that I could already see many flaws and ways in which it could be improved. Overall, this was a tremendous learning experience and I intend to return to this project as game engine design and game design in general is something I'm very passionate about.
